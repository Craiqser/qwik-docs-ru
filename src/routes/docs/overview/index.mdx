# Welcome to Qwik

Qwik is a new kind of web framework that can deliver instant loading web applications at any size or complexity. Your sites and apps can boot with about 1kb of JS (regardless of application complexity), and achieve consistent performance at scale.

## Qwik Goals

<div class="card-grid">
  <div class="card">
    <h3>General-purpose</h3>
    <p>Qwik can be used to build any type of web site or application</p>
  </div>
    <div class="card">
    <h3>Instant-on</h3>
    <p>Unlike other frameworks, Qwik is resumable which means Qwik applications require 0 hydration. This allows Qwik apps to have instant-on interactivity, regardless of size or complexity</p>
  </div>
    <div class="card">
    <h3>Optimized for speed</h3>
    <p>Qwik has unprecedented performance, offering sub-second full page loads even on mobile devices. Qwik achieves this by delivering pure HTML, and incrementally loading JS only as-needed.</p>

## Does page speed really matter?

Put simply: slow sites deter visitors, costing businesses millions. Fast sites have better SEO, better UX, and are more profitable.
