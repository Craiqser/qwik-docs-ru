# Static Site Generation Config

Below is an example of a `src/entry.static.tsx` file, which is the initial file used for a Static Site Generation (SSG) build. Just like a server's entry file for SSR, such as `src/entry.server.tsx`, it should import your app's `render` function from `./entry.ssr`.

```typescript
// file: src/entry.static.tsx
import { qwikCityGenerate } from '@builder.io/qwik-city/static/node';
import render from './entry.ssr';
import { fileURLToPath } from 'url';
import { join } from 'path';

qwikCityGenerate(render, {
  origin: 'https://qwik.builder.io',
  outDir: join(fileURLToPath(import.meta.url), '..', '..', 'dist'),
});
```

You then can add the `build.ssg` script to `package.json` for building the generator code and add it to the `build` script to have it ready after each build:

```json
  "build": "npm run typecheck && npm run build.client && npm run build.ssr && npm run build.ssg",
  "build.ssg": "vite build --ssr src/entry.static.tsx",
```

In node you can run the generation after building using:
```bash
node server/entry.static.js
```

Your build files will be generated into the `dist` folder, as configured in `src/entry.static.tsx`.

## SSG Config

The `src/entry.static.tsx` file also includes the SSG config, which would be custom for each implementation.

### `origin`

The URL `origin`, which is a combination of the scheme (protocol) and hostname (domain).
For example, `https://qwik.builder.io` has the protocol `https://` and domain `qwik.builder.io`.
However, the `origin` does _not_ include a `pathname`.

The `origin` is used to provide a full URL during Static Site Generation (SSG), and to
simulate a complete URL rather than just the `pathname`. For example, in order to
render a correct canonical tag URL or URLs within the `sitemap.xml`, the `origin` must
be provided too.

If the site also starts with a pathname other than `/`, please use the `basePathname`
option in the Qwik City config options.

### `outDir`

The `outDir` is a file system output directory where the static files should be written. In the example above, it's using Node's [fileURLToPath](https://nodejs.org/api/url.html#urlfileurltopathurl) to create an absolute file system path to write the static HTML files to.

## Javascript Runtimes

For a Javascript project, it's quite common for the build's runtime to be built on top of [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/docs/). However, the core of Qwik City static site generation isn't tied to using only Node.js, which is why the `qwikCityGenerate()` function is imported from `@builder.io/qwik-city/static/node`. By scoping the generate function to a specific runtime, such as Node.js, this gives Qwik City the flexibility to also generate SSG from other runtimes in the future, such as [Deno](https://deno.land/) or [Bun](https://bun.sh/).
