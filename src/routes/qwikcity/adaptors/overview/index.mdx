# Adaptors and Middleware

Qwik City middleware is a glue code that connects server rendering framework (such as Cloudflare, Netlify, Express etc.) with the Qwik City meta-framework.

Qwik City comes pre-bundle with:

- [cloudflare-pages](../cloudflare-pages/index.mdx)
- [netlify-edge](../netlify-edge/index.mdx)
- [node](../node/index.mdx)

## Build

Use Qwik City vite cli `--ssr` to specify the SSR entry

```bash
vite build --ssr src/entry.MIDDLEWARE.ts
```

default output directory is `./server` and it is configurable by setting `qwikVite` plugin option

```typescript
// file vite.config.ts
import { qwikVite } from '@builder.io/qwik/optimizer';

export default defineConfig(() => {
  return {
    plugins: [
      // ...other plugins
      qwikVite({
        ssr: {
          outDir: 'CUSTOM_DIR',
        },
      }),
    ],
  };
});
```

## Advanced

The `requestHandler()` utility is what each of the above middleware bundles uses in order to translate their request/response to a standard format for Qwik City to use. This function can be used to provide middleware for specific server frameworks.

If there's middleware missing and you'd like it added, take a look at how the `requestHandler()` utility is used to handle requests for each of the middleware source-code above. Better yet, we'd love to have your middleware contributions! [PR's are welcome](https://github.com/BuilderIO/qwik/tree/main/packages/qwik-city/middleware)!
