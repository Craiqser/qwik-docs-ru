# Data Overview

Each route has the ability to add HTTP request and response handlers, allowing for developers to [retrieve](../retrieve/index.mdx) and [modify](../modify/index.mdx) data. The handlers can also be used by [endpoints](../endpoints/index.mdx), which only respond with data rather than a page's HTML.

This feature enables you to handle any request event, have side effects on the request pipeline, just before you render the component and respond with custom content. It is available to pages, layouts and endpoint routes, but not on regular components.

## Request and Response Handlers

On pages, layouts, and [endpoints](../endpoints/index.mdx), we can access request data by implementing request handler functions such as `onGet`, `onPost`, `onPut`, etc. These functions are executed according to the [HTTP method](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Methods) used for this route.

Additonally, an `onRequest` function can be used to handle any request method, rather than a specific one. For example, if both `onGet` and `onRequest` is provided, for a `GET` request, the `onGet` will be called. However, in this scenario, if a `POST` request method came in, then the `onRequest` handler would be called since an `onPost` was not provided.
The `onRequest` is available as a catch-all to any request methods that do not have a specific method.

```typescript
import type { RequestHandler } from '@builder.io/qwik-city';

export const onGet: RequestHandler<ProductData> = async ({ params }) => {
  // put your DB access here (hard coding data for simplicity)
  return {
    skuId: params.skuId,
    price: 123.45,
    description: `Description for ${params.skuId}`,
  };
};
```

## Request Event

The request handler functions receive a `RequestEvent` argument which has the following properties:

| Field      | Description                                                                   |
| ---------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `request`  | The request object                                                            |
| `response` | The response object, which can be used to set response `headers` and `status` |
| `url`      | URL which includes `pathname`, `hostname`, etc.                               |
| `next`     | Next middleware function                                                      |
| `abort`    | Request abort function                                                        |
| `params`   | Custom user params found within the URL                                       |
| `platform` | Platform data object (useful for Cloudflare, Netlify, etc)                    |
