# Route Parameters

Route Parameters are parts of the URLs that are extracted into parameters.

Imagine that you have a page with the following URLs where `[skuId]` can be any of the thousands of products that you have in your database. It would be impractical to create a route for each product. Instead, we need to define a Route Parameter (a part of the URL) that will be used to extract the `[skuId]`.

- `https://example.com/sku/[skuId]`
  - Will match: `https://example.com/sku/1234`
  - Will match: `https://example.com/sku/xyz-567`
- `https://example.com/sku/[skuId]/details`
  - Will match: `https://example.com/sku/1234/details`

```
src/
└── routes/
    └── sku/
        └── [skuId]/
            ├── index.tsx         # https://example.com/sku/1234
            └── details/
                └── index.tsx     # https://example.com/sku/1234/details
```

## Retrieving the Route Parameter from the URL

Once we have `[skuId]` in the URL, we need a way to retrieve it. This can be done by using `useLocation()` API.

```typescript
import { useLocation } from '@builder.io/qwik-city';

export default component$(() => {
  const location = useLocation();

  return (
    <div>
      <h1>SKU</h1>
      <p>Pathname: {location.pathname}</p>
      <p>Sku Id: {location.params.skuId}</p>
    </div>
  );
});
```

## Catch All Routes
It is also possible to create a catch-all routes by adding a directory like `[...slug]`. This works like the above described example but will also consider subsegments of the URI. It can also be applied on the `routes` root level.

```
src/
└── routes/
    └── sku/
        └── [...slug]/
            └── index.tsx
```

The above structure will match:
- `https://example.com/sku/1234`
- `https://example.com/sku/1234/detail`
- `https://example.com/sku/1234/detail/edit`
- etc

It is possible to limit catch-all routes by adding a subdirectory say `end-of-route` in `[...slug]` directory.

```
src/
└── routes/
    └── sku/
        └── [...slug]/
            ├── index.tsx
            └── end-of-route/
                └──index.tsx
```

The above structure will match:
- `https://example.com/sku/1234/5678/end-of-route`
