# Routing

Routing is a way to map public URLs for a site to specific components declared in your application.

Qwik City uses directory-based routing. This means that the structure of your routes directory drives the public-facing URLs that the user will see for your application. However, it differs slightly from traditional file-based routing, which we will discuss shortly.

## Directory-based Routing

Qwik City supports the following filetypes for routes

In the Qwik City routes directory, `folder-path` plus an `index` file map to a URL path. For example, if the user sees `https://example.com/some/path`, the component exported at `src/routes/some/path/index` (either `.mdx` or `.tsx`) will be shown.

```
src/
└── routes/
    └── some/
        └── path/
            └── index.tsx       # https://example.com/some/path
```

Note that the leaf file at the end of the route is named index. This is **important**. In other meta-frameworks you may be familiar with, there is a distinction made between `pages` and `data endpoints` or `API routes`. In Qwik City, there is no distinction, they are all `endpoints`.

To define an endpoint, you must a define an `index.[filetype]` where [filetype] can be one of `.ts`, `.tsx`, `.js`, `.jsx`, `.md`, or `.mdx`.

While the following directory structure:

```
src/
└── routes/
    ├── contact.tsx
    ├── about.tsx
    ├── store.tsx
    └── index.tsx
```

may work in other meta-frameworks that use file-based routing, Qwik City will not register a route for any non-index files. In Qwik City, the equivalent file structure would look like this:

```
src/
└── routes/
    ├── contact/
    │   └── index.tsx          # https://example.com/contact
    ├── about/
    │   └── index.tsx          # https://example.com/about
    ├── store/
    │   └── index.tsx          # https://example.com/store
    └── index/
        └── index.tsx          # https://example.com/index
```

At first, this may seem like extra work, but there are advantages to this approach. One advantage is being able to define component files in a route directory without them being rendered. Consider the following:

```
src/
└── routes/
    ├── index.tsx                     # https://example.com/
    └── some/
        ├── index.tsx                 # https://example.com/some
        └── path/
            ├── index.tsx             # https://example.com/some/path
            └── other_component.tsx   # this file is ignored and not mapped to any URL because it is not an index.
```

The `other_component.tsx` file can be imported and used inside of `path/index.tsx`, but is otherwise ignored by Qwik City.

## Implementing a Component

To return HTML for a specific route you will need to implement a component. For `.tsx` files the component must be exported as `default`. Alternatively, you can use `.mdx` extension discussed [later](../../../qwikcity/content/mdx/index.mdx).

```typescript
export default component$(() => {
  return <H1>Hello World!</H1>;
});
```

## `@qwik-city-plan`

Qwik City stores route information in files on disk. This is great for developer ergonomics but not useful for creating bundles and chunks. Additionally, in some environments - such as edge functions - there is no file system that can be accessed. For this reason, it is necessary to serialize the route information into a single file. This is done through the `@qwik-city-plan` import.

```typescript
import cityPlan from '@qwik-city-plan';
```

The `@qwik-city-plan` import is synthetic, meaning that it is created as part of the build step. It contains all of the information in the `/src/routes` folder in JavaScript format. The synthetic import is provided by the `qwikCity()` vite plugin available from `@builder.io/qwik-city/vite`.

## Advanced routing

Qwik City also supports:

- [Route Parameters](../../../qwikcity/routing/route-parameters/index.mdx)
- [Nested layouts](../../../qwikcity/layout/overview/index.mdx)
- [Menus](../../../qwikcity/content/menu/index.mdx)

These are discussed later.
