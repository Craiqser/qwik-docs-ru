# Top Layout

The default is that a page will create its layout stack by climbing up each directory until it gets to the `src/routes` directory. If at any point it should not continue climbing up the directories you can use the "top" layout feature.

A top layout means that the layout is always at the very top of the nested layout stack, and doesn't keep collecting parent layouts, even when there are parent directory layouts.

A top layout is specified by ending the layout filename with `!`, such as `layout!.tsx`.

```
src/
└── routes/
    ├── layout.tsx              # Root layout
    └── docs/
        ├── layout!.tsx         # Docs layout
        ├── index.tsx           # https://example.com/docs
        └── api/
            └── index.tsx       # https://example.com/docs/api
```

In the above example, there are two layouts in the parent directories of `src/routes/docs/api/index.tsx`. By default, the `/docs/api` page would be nested inside both layouts (the Root and Docs layout).

However, since the `src/routes/docs/layout!.tsx` filename ends with `!`, then this layout becomes the very top layout and the Root `src/routes/layout.tsx` layout is not a part of the stack.
