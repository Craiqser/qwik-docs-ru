One of Qwik's super powers lies in its lazy-loading features.

Qwik lazy-loads:

- **Independent of hierarchy**: Components can be loaded out of order. For example, the code for a child component can load before its parent code.
- **Based on interaction**: Code loading is deferred until a user interacts with a component.
- **More than just components**: Qwik lazy-loads any closure including components, event listeners, effects, and behaviors.

`$` marks a closure as lazy-loadable. For example `component$()` method makes the component lazy-loadable. When you see a `$` in Qwik code, you're crossing a lazy-loading boundary and have to be aware of special rules:

- any lexically scoped variables must be declared as `const`
- a captured variable/symbol must be either:
  - serializable
  - importable (Either from a different file as `import` or from this file using `export`)

If you want to ensure a component loads with another component, you create an inline component. Inline components load as a part of the parent component and are equivalent to how most other frameworks deal with components.

In this example, the `<App>` and a `<Greeter>` components are prepared for you. The `<Greeter />` component is declared using the `component$()` method and is a Qwik component. Remove the `component$()` to convert `<Greeter>` to an inline component.

Open the `Symbols` tab and notice that the `<Greeter />` component is no longer an independent export, but instead is bundled as part of the `<App>` component.
